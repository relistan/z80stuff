Dungeon Adventure
=================

A classic adventure game for the CP/M terminal written in Turbo Pascal.
Find the treasure, kill the monsters, explore the dungeon.

This is a little bit of a modernized take on classic adventure games.  It
relies on a fairly fast terminal and that it be a modern one that supports 256
colors.
